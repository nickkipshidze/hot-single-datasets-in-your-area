# Hot single datasets in your area!

<!-- This is such a stupid name why did I pick this?!?! -->

Find some of the best hot single datasets on Kaggle in need for some notebooks!

"Research" shows that one of the best ways to gain some attention on your Kaggle notebook, is to use a new, young, attractive, popular, but lonely dataset which will direct all the attention towards your notebook, and maybe picking up some upvotes along the way, earning yourself that sweet, sweet Kaggle medals.

## Boy oh boy! How do I run the code?!?! - Says you

Just run `$ python main.py` in your terminal... You must've to known this by now!

Here's the example output:

```
...

## How does it work?!

As you can see from the example output above, the program basically fetches all the latest Kaggle datasets, and sorts them by the secret sauce that is my evaluation function. The evaluation function looks for the dataset that is of high quality, has a lot of attention, has a lot of downloads, and has no notebooks linked to it. That's the perfect dataset to make a notebook on.
